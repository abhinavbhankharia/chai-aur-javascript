# JavaScript and Classes
JavaScript looks like it has classes (since ES6), but under the hood, it’s still a prototype-based language — not a true class-based one like Java, C++, or C#.
When you write class in JavaScript, it’s syntactic sugar — a prettier, more familiar way to define objects and set up inheritance based on prototypes.
